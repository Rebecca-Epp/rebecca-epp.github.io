# Welcome to my website!

I am Rebecca Epp, a Biochemistry PhD Student at Case Western Reserve University. I hold B.S. in Biochemistry from Hillsdale college. As an undergraduate, I conducted two independent research projects. I worked under the guidance of Dr. Lee Baron to characterize total antioxidant capacity in brewed cocoa using the radical scavenger 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. I also interned at the Mayo Clinic under the direction of Dr. John Hawse where I characterized genetic dependencies of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) - a particularly aggressive subtype with a paucity of treatment options - to facilitate targeted treatment. 

Currently, I am a graduate student in Dr. Ruth Keri's lab at the Cleveland Clinic. My thesis work in the Keri lab is guided by a desire to understand and decrease racial disparities in breast cancer. African American/Black women are 23% more likely to die from triple negative breast cancer compared to White women. The underlying molecular causes of this disparity remain poorly understood. Preliminary investigation identified Cyclin Dependent Kinase 10 (*CDK10*), a “dark” kinase that is both upregulated Black patients and correlated with patient survival in the TGCA database. Thus, my goal is to discover the molecular mechanism by which CDK10 drives cancer aggressiveness and leverage this knowledge to increase available treatment modalities for TNBC. To this end, I have demonstrated that CDK10 is essential for Checkpoint Kinase 1 (CHK1) phosphorylation in response to DNA damage, and that loss of CDK10 leads to chromosomal instability. Furthermore, CDK10 silencing results in G2M cell cycle arrest, presenting CDK10 as potential therapeutic target regardless of Rb status.
