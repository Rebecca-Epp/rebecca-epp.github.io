    "text": "Cancer Research Abstract\nDuring my internship at Mayo Clinic with Dr. John Hawse, I characterized genetic dependencies of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype with limited treatment options, to facilitate targeted treatment. I analyzed essentiality scores (DepMap) in breast cancer cell lines to identify specific genes whose expression was required specifically for TNBC cell viability. This inquiry identified six candidate genes (RHOA, CPTS1, PRKRA, RAD9A, HUS1, and RAD1) that were preferentially essential for TNBC cell viability compared to ER+ and non-transformed cells. Using over 40 breast cancer cell lines, I screened for the differential expression of the candidates and selected three TNBC cell lines and three ER+ HER2- cell lines to further characterize essentiality. I then used genetic silencing of CTPS1 and RAD1 to assess their impact on proliferation in TNBC cell lines using a luminescence-based viability assay and confirmed that that these two genes display subtype-specific dependencies. To discern their specific roles in TNBC viability, I examined the effects of CTPS1 and RAD1 silencing on the cell cycle and apoptosis. Cell cycle analyses with propidium iodide indicated that CTPS1 silencing leads to S-phase cell cycle arrest, while caspase 3/7 activity assays revealed no impact on apoptosis when CTPS1 was lost. Lastly, I independently identified a pharmaceutical company (StepPharma) that was developing a CTPS1 inhibitor. The company has since partnered with the Hawse lab, and they are investigating the impact of CTPS1 inhibition on breast and ovarian cancers. Notably, this led to a phase I clinical trial in solid tumors that was initiated in August 2024. These findings suggest that CTPS1 is a targetable vulnerability in TNBC. This work is currently in preparation for publication."

    "text": "Characterization of Total Antioxidant Capacity in Brewed COcoa\n\nMy research experience began under the guidance of Dr. Lee Baron at Hillsdale College. Dr. Baron’s research focuses on understanding the chemistry of antioxidants in health foods that provide protection from radical oxygen species (ROS). My investigation centered on relating the previously established health benefits of antioxidant consumption to cocoa. Often cocoa is alkalized to raise the pH and increase solubility in water. Previous research indicated that alkalization decreased the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of alkalized cocoa powder. However, these studies used a hexane defatting process to prepare samples, likely removing the hydrophobic flavonoids that contribute to TAC. In contrast, this study examined cocoa in its commonly consumed form – as a brewed beverage. Cocoa samples were brewed using a French press and analyzed daily for pH, percent total dissolved solids (%TDS), conductivity, and TAC. TAC was measured as a function of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) IC50. Thus, an analyte with a lower IC50 has a higher overall antioxidant capacity. I developed the DPPH assay for use on brewed beverage and performed it using brewed cocoa of varying alkalization levels from the brands King Arthur Baking, Hershey’s, and Ghirardelli. Across all three brands, the alkalized cocoa brews had lower IC50 values, indicating a higher TAC. Doubly-alkalized “black cocoa” from King Arthur Baking had the lowest recorded IC50. Increased TAC can be attributed in part to greater solubility of the contributing compounds due to the increased pH of the solution. Furthermore, the assay I developed has remained in use as the lab investigated TAC of coffee and tea."

I hold B.S. in Biochemistry from Hillsdale College. As an undergraduate, I conducted two independent research projects. I worked under the guidance of Dr. Lee Baron to characterize total antioxidant capacity in brewed cocoa using the radical scavenger 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. I also interned at the Mayo Clinic under the direction of Dr. John Hawse where I characterized genetic dependencies of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) - a particularly aggressive subtype with a paucity of treatment options - to facilitate targeted treatment.\nCurrently, I am a graduate student in Dr. Ruth Keri’s lab at the Cleveland Clinic. My thesis work in the Keri lab is guided by a desire to understand and decrease racial disparities in breast cancer. African American/Black women are 23% more likely to die from TNBC compared to White women. The underlying molecular causes of this disparity remain poorly understood. Preliminary investigation identified Cyclin Dependent Kinase 10 (CDK10), a “dark” kinase that is both upregulated Black patients and correlated with patient survival in the TGCA database. Thus, my goal is to discover the molecular mechanism by which CDK10 drives cancer aggressiveness and leverage this knowledge to increase available treatment modalities for TNBC. To this end, I have demonstrated that CDK10 is essential for Checkpoint Kinase 1 (CHK1) phosphorylation in response to DNA damage, and that loss of CDK10 leads to chromosomal instability. Furthermore, CDK10 silencing results in G2/M cell cycle arrest, presenting CDK10 as potential therapeutic target regardless of Rb status.\nPlease feel free to contact me if are interested in collaborating."

    "text": "Calculating age-specific prevalences of arthritis and PFDA levels\nI next examined the PFAS levels and arthritis prevelance by age. From the age data, I created a factor with three levels (20-39, 40-80, and 80+). As expected, the prevalence of arthritis increases with age, reaching almost 50% in the 80+ group.\nI also looked at PFDA levels in the same age group. As stated above, this data was right skewed (skewness coefficient &gt; 0.2), so I used a Log2 transformation to make this distribution more symmetric. After the transformation, I was able to see that the PFDA variable has a bimodal distribution. This is because all values that fall below the lower limit of detection are coded as 0.07. I compared the Log2(PFAS) data across three age groups, and did not see a substantial shift in the distribution.\nBecause of the observed bimodal distribution, I decided to change the PFDA variable from a continuous variable to a factor (“Detectable PFDA” and “Below LOD”). I did this because I was interested in seeing if PFDA levels corresponded with higher arthritis diagnoses, and I did not think it was appropriate to discard such a large portion of the data because PFDA were not detected. This alteration changed my hypothesis slightly. I am now examining whether a detectable level of PFDA is associated with arthritis."

Specifically, albumin levels are higher (p &lt; 0.001), while CRP (p &lt; 0.01) and WBC count (p &lt; 0.01) are both lower in the “Detectable PFOA” group.

There is no statistically significant different in WBC count. Together, the higher CRP levels and lower serum albumin in subjects diagnosed with arthritis indicates that there may be a link between inflammation and arthritis. However, this data is preliminary, and more analysis is necessary to establish a clear relationship.\nInterestingly, PDFA do not increase in subjects with an arthritis diagnosis, which proves my hypothesis incorrect."
